# django-reactJs
This web application is supposed to solve a challenge. It uses Django Rest Framework for the backend and ReactJs in the frontend. Further information about the challenge can be found following this link: https://github.com/hiddenfounders/web-coding-challenge/blob/master/README.md

## Backend: Django/ Django-rest-framework / MongoDB

Tools:
- django 1.9
- django-rest-framework 3.3.1
- django_mongoengine 0.2.1
- python 3.6
- mongoengine 0.15.0
- pymongo 3.6.0
- MongoDB 3.4
    
How it works:

- Install the database management system:
    Go to MongoDB [website](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center#community). Find your development environment, then download MongoDB installer.
    You can choose a specific version of MongoDB by checking the All version binaries link in the page.
    Install your MongoDB database now.
    
- Install python version 3.6, together with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) and [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/). 
- Clone the repository from my [github](https://github.com/Mehdi6/django-reactjs), and place it in a new folder.
- Install a virtualenv:
    run the command line, place yourself inside the project's folder, then create your new virtualenv.
    Install the requirements by running the following command line: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Import data:
    Now we need to create a new database where our application data will live.
    All you need is to run the data_import.py script. Go to the django_backend folder and run the `data_import.py` script. This script will import data from a remote server about shops and transfer them to a new database. Don't forget to run a MongoDB database instance first in your local environment.
    
- Run the server
* First run the command : `python manage.py migrate`
* Then: `python manage.py runserver`
* The server is now running on http://localhost:8000/

## Frontend: React/ Redux / NodeJS

Tools:
- react 
- redux
- react-google-maps
- react-bootstrap
- axios
- webpack
    
How it works:
    
- Install npm: go to https://nodejs.org/en/ and download NodeJs. Then install it in your environment
- Install the modules: open the command line and locate yourself in the react_frontend folder. Then run the next command line `npm install`
- Launch the server: `npm run start` to run the frontend server. 
- The server is now running on http://localhost:8083/

Thanks to the quick starting [project](https://github.com/ZachLiuGIS/reactjs-auth-django-rest) by [@ZachLiuGIS](https://github.com/ZachLiuGIS) that demonstrate very well the combination of DRF with ReactJs to build a web app with user authentication features.
