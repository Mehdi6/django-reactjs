# django-reactJs
This web application is supposed to solve a challenge. It uses Django Rest Framework for the backend and ReactJs in the frontend. Further information about the challenge can be found following this link: https://github.com/hiddenfounders/web-coding-challenge/blob/master/README.md

## Backend: Django/ Django-rest-framework / MongoDB

Tools:
- django 1.9
- django-rest-framework 3.3.1
- python 3.6
- mongoengine 0.15.0
- pymongo 3.6.0

- MongoDB 3.4
    
How it works:

- install the database:
    Go to MongoDB website (https://www.mongodb.com/download-center#community). Find your developpement environement, then download MongoDB installer.
    You can choose a specific version of MongoDB by checking the All version binaries link in the page.
    Install your MongoDB database now.
    
- install python version 3.6, together with pip and virtualenv.
- clone the repository from my github https://github.com/Mehdi6/django-reactjs, and place it in a new folder.
- install a virtualenv:
    run the command line, place yourself inside the folder of the project then create activate your new virtualenv.
    install the requirements by runing the following command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- import data
    Now we need to create a new database where our application data will live.
    All you need is to run the data_import.py script. Go to the django_backend folder and run the data_import script. This script will import dump data from a remote server about shops and transfer them to a new database.
    
- run the server
    first run the command : `python manage.py migrate`
    then: `python manage.py runserver`
    
## Frontend: React/ Redux / NodeJS

Tools:
- react 
- redux
- react-google-maps
- react-bootstrap
- axios
- webpack
    
How it works:
    
- install npm: go to https://nodejs.org/en/ and download NodeJs. Then install it in your environment
- install the modules: open the command line and locate yourself in the react_frontend folder. Then run the next command line `npm install`
- launch the server: `npm run start` to run the frontend server.
